# To Do

* Check ansible-galaxy for potentially useful roles
* Clean up variable usage
* Make roles usable standalone
* What to do about encrypting data?
	* An issue is autorestarting in the case OVH needs to intervene (for
	example if the monitoring indicates non-responsiveness), which at least at
	first is a reboot.
