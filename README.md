# DFD Debian Libvirt VM cluster via Ansible

Bare-metal and Libvirt virtual machine spin up via Ansible for a 'SOHO/KOHO
infrastructure' cluster, including mail server, groupware, and web hosting.

The main configuration and management of virtual hosts is not done here. The
author uses [Ansible to manage the hosts for the SOHO/KOHO
cluster](https://gitlab.com/danielfdickinson/debian-soho-ansible-dfd).

This repository should not include any unencrypted private or even particularly
personalised information. It does, however, depend on adding some (to be
documented) variables and supplying them to Ansible vaults.

It is designed for DFD's uses and is likely not a 'plug and play' option for
others. It is Daniel's hope, however, that it still proves informative and
useful.
