# DFD Debian VM cluster on Libvirt Ansible configuration

Daniel F. Dickinson's Libvirt virtual machine deployment for a 'personal
infrastructure'. This repository takes a cluster spun up via Terraform and adds
and updates configuration to finalize the cluster for use.

This repository should not include any private or even particularly personalised
information. It does, however, depend on adding some (to be documented)
variables and supplying them to Ansible vaults.

Despite not having personalised details, it is still designed for DFD's uses and
is likely not a 'plug and play' option for others. It is Daniel's hope, however,
that it still proves informative and useful.
